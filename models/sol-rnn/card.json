{"title": "Solubility Prediction", "details": "Recurrent (bi-LSTM) neural network with concatenated amino acid frequencies for predicting solubility. Developed by Andrew White and Mehrad Ansari using data from PROSO II database in TFJS.", "use": "Peptides or proteins expressed in E. coli that are less than 200 residues long. May provide solubility predictions more broadly applicable.", "factors": "Solubility was defined in PROSO II as sequence that was transfectable, expressible, secretable, separable, and soluble in E. coli system.", "metrics": "Test accuracy 0.69. Test AUC 0.75", "evaluation": "Withheld positive and negative examples", "training": "18453 positive (length range: 19-198) and negative (length range: 22-198) sequences.", "caveats": "This data is mostly long sequences and so may not be as applicable to solid-phase synthesized peptides. The model accuracy is low.", "ethics": "None noted"}
