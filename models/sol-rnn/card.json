    "title": "Solubility Prediction",
    "details": "Recurrent (bi-LSTM) neural network for predicting solubility. Developed by Andrew White using data from PROSO II database in TFJS.",
    "use": "Peptides or proteins expressed in E. coli that are less than 200 residues long. May provide solubility predictions more broadly applicable.",
    "factors": "Solubility was defined in PROSO II as sequence that was transfectible, expressible, secretable, separable, and soluble in E. coli system.",
    "metrics": "Test accuracy 0.68. Test AUC 0.74",
    "evaluation": "Withheld positive and negative examples",
    "training": "18453 positive and negative sequences.",
    "caveats": "This data is mostly long sequences and so may not be as applicable to solid-phase synthesized peptides. The model accuracy is low.",
    "ethics": "None noted"
