{"title": "Nonfouling Prediction", "details": "Recurrent (LSTM) neural network for predicting resistance to non-specific interactions (nonfouling). Developed by Andrew White using data from Barrett 2018. Negative examples are insoluble peptides, hemolytic peptides, and scrambled positives. Sample weights were used to remove negative example dataset sizes", "use": "Short peptides between 2 and 20 residues", "factors": "The dataset was gathered based on mechanism proposed in White 2012.", "metrics": "Test accuracy 0.81. Test AUC 0.93", "evaluation": "Withheld positive and negative examples", "training": "17185 positive (length range: 5-11) and negative (length range: 5-198) sequences", "caveats": "This data is mostly short sequences. The mechanism is indirect. The negative examples have insoluble peptides overrepresented so that the accuracy may be inflated if only comparing soluble peptides.", "ethics": "None noted"}
